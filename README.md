    Feed Reader Testing

===============================

## Description

This project is for my Udacity Front-end Nano-Degree. The point is to familiarize
myself with "test-driven development" using Jasmine to write a number of tests
against a pre-existing application. These
will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the
event handling and DOM manipulation.

#### Running on local computer

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Open index.html to the browser.

### Contributing

Udacity provided the starter code which included everything except for the
finished Jasmine testing.

The Udacity [Project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric) has a list of all the minimium requirements to complete the project.

I also received a lot of pointers from my Udacity peer Matthew Cranford's [Feed Reader
Walkthrough Part 1 – Starter Code](https://matthewcranford.com/feed-reader-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code/).
This helped me get started on this project. Thanks!

This article also helped with the last test [Testing JavaScript with
Jasmine — Basics](https://medium.com/letsboot/testing-javascript-with-jasmine-basics-48efe03cf973).

#### Learned

I feel much more comfortable using Jasmine now and will be better able to
implement testing in later projects.
